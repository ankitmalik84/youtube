# Local Model Notebook

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to work with local Large Language Models (LLMs) using Ollama. It provides a comprehensive guide for setting up and interacting with local AI models on your own machine, eliminating the need for cloud-based API calls.

## Features

- **Local Model Setup**: Complete setup guide for Ollama and local LLMs
- **Multiple Integration Methods**: Three different approaches to interact with local models
- **Model Comparison**: Examples with different models (Llama 3.2, DeepSeek)
- **API Compatibility**: Shows how to use OpenAI-compatible libraries with local models

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- At least 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- 2GB+ free disk space for models

### Required Python Packages

```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install ollama
pip install openai
pip install ipython
```

## Installation

### 1. Install Ollama

Visit [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and download the installer for your operating system.

### 2. Verify Installation

After installation, Ollama should start automatically. You can verify it's running by visiting:

```
http://localhost:11434/
```

You should see the message "Ollama is running".

### 3. Download Models

Open a terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

For slower machines, use the smaller model:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

## Usage

### Method 1: Direct HTTP API Calls

The notebook shows how to make direct HTTP requests to the Ollama API:

```python
import requests

OLLAMA_API = "http://localhost:11434/api/chat"
HEADERS = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
MODEL = "llama3.2"

payload = {
    "model": MODEL,
    "messages": messages,
    "stream": False
}

response = requests.post(OLLAMA_API, json=payload, headers=HEADERS)
```

### Method 2: Using the Ollama Python Package

A cleaner approach using the official Ollama Python package:

```python
import ollama

response = ollama.chat(model="llama3.2", messages=messages)
print(response['message']['content'])
```

### Method 3: OpenAI-Compatible Interface

Use the OpenAI Python library to interact with local models:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

ollama_client = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')

response = ollama_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="llama3.2",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

## Available Models

The notebook demonstrates several models:

1. **Llama 3.2** - Meta's latest open-source model
2. **Llama 3.2:1b** - Smaller, faster version for limited resources
3. **DeepSeek R1:1.5b** - Alternative model for comparison

To download additional models:

```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:1.5b
```

## Key Concepts Explained

### Neural Networks

The notebook includes explanations of core LLM concepts:

- **Neural Networks**: Multi-layered systems that process information through weighted connections
- **Attention Mechanisms**: How models focus on relevant parts of input sequences
- **Transformer Architecture**: The foundation of modern language models

### API Compatibility

The notebook explains how Ollama provides OpenAI-compatible endpoints, allowing you to use familiar libraries with local models.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ollama not running**

   - Start the service: `ollama serve`
   - Check if port 11434 is available

2. **Model download fails**

   - Check internet connection
   - Ensure sufficient disk space
   - Try downloading smaller models first

3. **Slow responses**

   - Use smaller models (e.g., `llama3.2:1b`)
   - Close other applications to free up RAM
   - Consider upgrading hardware

4. **Memory issues**
   - Reduce model size
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Restart Ollama service

### Performance Tips

- Use smaller models for faster responses
- Close other applications when running large models
- Consider using GPU acceleration if available
- Monitor system resources during model execution

## Examples in the Notebook

The notebook includes practical examples:

1. **Basic Chat**: Simple conversation with local models
2. **Model Comparison**: Testing different models side-by-side
3. **API Integration**: Using various libraries to interact with models
4. **Concept Explanation**: Understanding LLM fundamentals

## Security and Privacy

### Benefits of Local Models

- **Privacy**: No data sent to external servers
- **Control**: Full control over model behavior and responses
- **Offline**: Works without internet connection
- **Customization**: Ability to fine-tune models for specific needs

### Considerations

- Models require significant disk space
- Performance depends on local hardware
- Regular updates needed for security patches

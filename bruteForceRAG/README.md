# Expert Knowledge Worker - RAG System

A **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** system built for **Insurellm**, an Insurance Tech company. This project creates an expert knowledge worker that can accurately answer questions about company employees and products using a cost-effective, brute-force RAG approach.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This RAG system addresses the common problem of AI chatbots "hallucinating" or providing inaccurate information. By implementing a retrieval-augmented approach, the system:

- **Retrieves** relevant documents from the knowledge base
- **Augments** user queries with relevant context
- **Generates** accurate, contextual responses

### Key Features

✅ **Accurate Responses** - Eliminates hallucination by grounding answers in company data  
✅ **Cost-Effective** - Uses GPT-4o-mini for budget-conscious implementation  
✅ **Real-Time Streaming** - Provides instant responses with streaming UI  
✅ **Simple Architecture** - Brute-force approach perfect for learning and prototyping  
✅ **Easy Deployment** - One-click Gradio interface  
✅ **Extensible** - Easy to add new employees and products

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API Key
- Internet connection for API calls

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd expert-knowledge-worker
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install openai gradio python-dotenv
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### 5. Prepare Knowledge Base

Create the following directory structure:

```
knowledge-base/
├── employees/
│   ├── Lancaster.md
│   ├── Chen.md
│   └── ...
└── products/
    ├── Carllm.md
    ├── Homellm.md
    └── ...
```

### 6. Run the Application

```bash
jupyter notebook bruteForceRag.ipynb
```

Or convert to Python script and run:

```bash
python rag_system.py
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
expert-knowledge-worker/
│
├── bruteForceRAG/
│   └── bruteForceRag.ipynb     # Main notebook
├── knowledge-base/
│   ├── employees/              # Employee information files
│   └── products/               # Product information files
├── .env                        # Environment variables
├── .gitignore                  # Git ignore file
└── README.md                   # This file
```

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. Context Retrieval

```python
def get_relevant_context(message):
    relevant_context = []
    for context_title, context_details in context.items():
        if context_title.lower() in message.lower():
            relevant_context.append(context_details)
    return relevant_context
```

The system uses simple string matching to find relevant documents. When a user mentions "Lancaster", it retrieves Avery Lancaster's complete profile.

### 2. Context Augmentation

```python
def add_context(message):
    relevant_context = get_relevant_context(message)
    if relevant_context:
        message += "\n\nThe following additional context might be relevant..."
    return message
```

User queries are enhanced with relevant context before being sent to the AI model.

### 3. Response Generation

The enhanced query is sent to GPT-4o-mini with a system message that instructs the model to be accurate and admit when it doesn't know something.

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Employee Queries

```
User: "Who is Lancaster?"
System: Returns complete profile of Avery Lancaster including role, history, compensation, etc.

User: "What's Avery's salary?"
System: Provides current salary information from Lancaster's profile.
```

### Product Queries

```
User: "Tell me about Carllm"
System: Returns product details, features, pricing, and roadmap.

User: "What's the pricing for Carllm?"
System: Provides detailed pricing tiers and features.
```

### General Queries

```
User: "Who are the employees?"
System: Lists available employee information.

User: "What products do we have?"
System: Lists available products.
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Model Selection

```python
MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"  # Cost-effective option
# MODEL = "gpt-4"      # Higher quality but more expensive
```

### System Message

```python
system_message = """You are an expert in answering accurate questions about Insurellm,
the Insurance Tech company. Give brief, accurate answers. If you don't know the answer,
say so. Do not make anything up if you haven't been provided with relevant context."""
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Employees

1. Create a new `.md` file in `knowledge-base/employees/`
2. Use the filename as the key (e.g., `Smith.md` → searchable as "Smith")
3. Include comprehensive employee information

### Adding New Products

1. Create a new `.md` file in `knowledge-base/products/`
2. Include product features, pricing, roadmap, etc.
3. File will be automatically loaded on restart

### Improving Context Matching

For better matching, you can enhance the `get_relevant_context` function:

```python
def get_relevant_context(message):
    # Add fuzzy matching
    # Add keyword extraction
    # Add semantic similarity
    pass
```

## 🚀 Production Improvements

This is a prototype implementation. For production use, consider:

### 1. Vector Database Integration

```python
# Replace string matching with semantic search
import pinecone
import weaviate
```

### 2. Advanced Chunking

```python
# Implement intelligent document chunking
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
```

### 3. Caching

```python
# Add response caching
import redis
```

### 4. Authentication

```python
# Add user authentication
import streamlit_authenticator
```

### 5. Rate Limiting

```python
# Implement API rate limiting
from slowapi import Limiter
```
